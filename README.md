# HeartAttack
Give people heart attacks (this is not a metaphor)

This is a joke app I and a friend created for a local hackathon. Please do not take this premise seriously.
Currently only searches up foods to eat and provides ranking based on calorie content of food.

Possible features if we ever decide to continue app:
Add social media integration
Add ways to take this more seriously
Provide better feedback on the point of this app (lone searchbar on top is not enough)
